# AWS API Abuse Detection

**Cloud-Native Detection Pipeline for Unauthorized AWS CLI Activity**

## üìå Project Overview

This project simulates an AWS credential abuse scenario and demonstrates how to detect it using only **AWS-native services**. An attacker uses stolen credentials to perform identity enumeration via the AWS CLI. This behavior is captured and alerted in real time using **CloudTrail**, **EventBridge**, and **SNS**‚Äîwith no third-party tools required.

The goal: Build a production-ready detection pipeline that reflects real-world cloud security operations.

## üéØ Objectives

- Simulate a **cloud intrusion** using compromised AWS access keys
- Detect suspicious API usage (`sts get-caller-identity`) via **CloudTrail**
- Build a **real-time alerting pipeline** using EventBridge and SNS
- Send structured email alerts to defenders
- Validate alerts by analyzing log artifacts in S3

High-level architecture of a real-time detection system that identifies suspicious AWS API calls using CloudTrail, EventBridge, and SNS. The pipeline triggers email alerts to notify users when attacker-like behavior (e.g., sts:GetCallerIdentity) is detected. Simulated attacker activity was generated using Kali Linux with stolen credentials.

## Attack Simulation

Using Kali Linux, AWS CLI was configured with stolen access credentials. The attacker executed:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
This command is commonly used by adversaries to validate access and enumerate the AWS account.

Detection Rule
The following EventBridge rule was created to detect unauthorized identity enumeration:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "source": ["aws.sts"],
  "detail-type": ["AWS API Call via CloudTrail"],
  "detail": {
    "eventName": ["GetCallerIdentity"]
  }
}
Once matched, the rule forwards the event to an SNS topic with email subscription(s).

Alerting and Notification
Upon detection, SNS sends an email alert to the defender‚Äôs inbox. The alert includes:

API call details (eventName, accountId, sourceIPAddress)

A reference to the CloudTrail log file in S3

Region, timestamp, and metadata for context

End-to-End Workflow View

Results
Real-time detection of unauthorized API usage

Alert delivery within seconds of attacker activity

Verified end-to-end traceability from attack to alert

All components used are AWS-native (no third-party tools)

Skills Demonstrated
Detection engineering with native AWS services

SOC-style alert triage and incident validation

Threat simulation using attacker perspective (Kali + AWS CLI)

CloudTrail + S3 log analysis

Event-driven architecture design in AWS

Opportunities for Future Enhancements
Detect additional suspicious APIs (CreateAccessKey, PassRole, etc.)

Add remediation actions (e.g., auto-disable keys via Lambda)

Centralize logs in OpenSearch or SIEM for advanced triage

Visualize alerts in CloudWatch or Grafana dashboards

Add multi-stage detection logic across services
